0.4.1 (2014-07-08)
==================

- Compatibility for Python 3. I introduced a meta class in Morepath
  0.4 and Python 3 did not like this. Now the tests pass again in
  Python 3.

- remove ``generic.lookup``, unused since Morepath 0.4.

- Increase test coverage back to 100%.

0.4 (2014-07-07)
================

- **BREAKING CHANGE** Move to class-based application registries. This
  breaks old code and it needs to be updated. The update is not
  difficult and amounts to:

  * subclass ``morepath.App`` instead of instantiating it to create a
    new app. Use subclasses for extension too.

  * To get a WSGI object you can plug into a WSGI server, you need to
    instantiate the app class first.

  Old way::

     app = morepath.App()

  So, the ``app`` object that you use directives on is an
  instance. New way::

    class app(morepath.App):
        pass

  So, now it's a class. The directives look the same as before, so this
  hasn't changed::

     @app.view(model=Foo)
     def foo_default(self, request):
        ...

  To extend an application with another one, you used to have to pass
  the ``extends`` arguments. Old way::

    sub_app = morepath.App(extends=[core_app])

  This has now turned into subclassing. New way::

    class sub_app(core_app):
        pass

  There was also a ``variables`` argument to specify an application
  that can be mounted. Old way::

     app = morepath.App(variables=['foo'])

  This is now a class attribute. New way::

     class app(morepath.App):
         variables = ['foo']

  The ``name`` argument to help debugging is gone; we can look at the
  class name now. The ``testing_config`` argument used internally in
  the Morepath tests has also become a class attribute.

  In the old system, the application object was both configuration
  point and WSGI object. Old way::

      app = morepath.App()

      # configuration
      @app.path(...)
      ...

      # wsgi
      morepath.run(app)

  In the Morepath 0.4 this has been split. As we've already seen, the
  application *class* serves. To get a WSGI object, you need to first
  *instantiate* it. New way::

     class app(morepath.App):
       pass

     # configuration
     @app.path(...)
     ...

     # wsgi
     morepath.run(app())

  To mount an application manually with variables, we used to need the
  special ``mount()`` method. Old way::

    mounted_wiki_app = wiki_app.mount(wiki_id=3)

  In the new system, mounting is done during instantiation of the app::

    mounted_wiki_app = wiki_app(wiki_id=3)

  Class names in Python are usually spelled with an upper case. In the
  Morepath docs the application object has been spelled with a lower
  case. We've used lower-case class names for application objects even
  in the updated docs for example code, but feel free to make them
  upper-case in your own code if you wish.

  Why this change? There are some major benefits to this change:

  * both extending and mounting app now use natural Python mechanisms:
    subclassing and instantation.

  * it allows us to expose the facility to create new directives to
    the API. You can create application-specific directives.

- You can define your own directives on your applications using the
  ``directive`` directive::

    @my_app.directive('my_directive')

  This exposes details of the configuration system which is
  underdocumented for now; study the ``morepath.directive`` module
  source code for examples.

- Document how to use more.static to include static resources into
  your application.

- Add a ``recursive=False`` option to the config.scan method. This
  allows the non-recursive scanning of a package. Only its
  ``__init__.py`` will be scanned.

- To support scanning a single module non-recursively we need a
  feature that hasn't landed in mainline Venusian yet, so depend on
  Venusifork for now.

- A small optimization in the publishing machinery. Less work is done
  to update the generic function lookup context during routing.

0.3 (2014-06-23)
================

- Ability to absorb paths entirely in path directive, as per issue #132.

- Refactor of config engine to make Venusian and immediate config more
  clear.

- Typo fix in docs (Remco Wendt).

- Get version number in docs from setuptools.

- Fix changelog so that PyPI page generates HTML correctly.

- Fix PDF generation so that the full content is generated.

- Ability to mark a view as internal. It will be available to
  ``request.view()`` but will give 404 on the web. This is useful for
  structuring JSON views for reusability where you don't want them to
  actually show up on the web.

- A ``request.child(something).view()`` that had this view in turn
  call a ``request.view()`` from the context of the ``something``
  application would fail -- it would not be able to look up the view
  as lookups still occurred in the context of the mounting
  application. This is now fixed. (thanks Ying Zhong for reporting it)

  Along with this fix refactored the request object so it keeps a
  simple ``mounted`` attribute instead of a stack of ``mounts``; the
  stack-like nature was not in use anymore as mounts themselves have
  parents anyway. The new code is simpler.

0.2 (2014-04-24)
================

- Python 3 support, in particular Python 3.4 (Alec Munro - fudomunro
  on github).

- Link generation now takes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` into account.

- Morepath 0.1 had a security system, but it was undocumented. Now
  it's documented (docs now in `Morepath Security`_), and some of its
  behavior was slightly tweaked:

  * new ``verify_identity`` directive.

  * ``permission`` directive was renamed to ``permission_rule``.

  * default unauthorized error is 403 Forbidden, not 401 Unauthorized.

  * ``morepath.remember`` and ``morepath.forbet`` renamed to
    ``morepath.remember_identity`` and ``morepath.forget_identity``.

- Installation documentation tweaks. (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)

- ``.gitignore`` tweaks (Auke Willem Oosterhoff)
