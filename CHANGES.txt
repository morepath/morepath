0.2 (unreleased)
================

- Python 3 support, in particular Python 3.4 (Alec Munro - fudomunro
  on github)

- Link generation now takes ``SCRIPT_NAME`` into account.

  documented, and some of its behavior was slightly tweaked:

  * ``permission`` directive was renamed to ``permission_rule``.

  * default unauthorized error is 403 Forbidden, not 401 Unauthorized.

  * ``morepath.remember`` and ``morepath.forbet`` renamed to
    ``morepath.remember_identity`` and ``morepath.forget_identity``.
