Developing Morepath
===================

Install Morepath for development
--------------------------------

.. highlight:: sh

First make sure you have virtualenv_ installed for Python 2.7.

.. _virtualenv: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv

Now create a new virtualenv somewhere for Morepath development and activate
de environment::

  $ virtualenv /path/to/ve_morepath
  $ source /path/to/ve_morepath/bin/activate

You should also be able to recycle an existing virtualenv, but this
guarantees a clean one.

Clone Morepath from github and go to the morepath directory::

  $ git clone git@github.com:morepath/morepath.git
  $ cd morepath

Now we need to run bootstrap.py to set up buildout, using the Python from the
virtualenv we've created before::

  $ python bootstrap.py

This installs buildout, which can now set up the rest of the development
environment::

  $ bin/buildout

This downloads and installs various dependencies and tools.

Running the tests
-----------------

You can run the tests using `py.test`_. Buildout has installed it for
you in the ``bin`` subdirectory of your project::

  $ bin/py.test morepath

To generate test coverage information as HTML do::

  $ bin/py.test morepath --cov morepath --cov-report html

You can then point your web browser to the ``htmlcov/index.html`` file
in the project directory and click on modules to see detailed coverage
information.

.. _`py.test`: http://pytest.org/latest/

flake8
------

The buildout also installs flake8_, which is a tool that
can do various checks for common Python mistakes using pyflakes_ and
checks for PEP8_ style compliance.

To do pyflakes and pep8 checking do::

  $ bin/flake8 morepath

.. _flake8: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8

.. _pyflakes: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes

.. _pep8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

radon
-----

The buildout installs radon_. This is a tool that can check various
measures of code complexity.

To check for `cyclomatic complexity`_ (excluding the tests)::

  $ bin/radon cc morepath -e "morepath/tests*"

To filter for anything not ranked ``A``::

  $ bin/radon cc morepath --min B -e "morepath/tests*"

And to see the maintainability index::

  $ bin/radon mi morepath -e "morepath/tests*"
