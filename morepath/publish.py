"""
Functionality to turn a :class:`morepath.Request` into a
:class:`morepath.Response` using Morepath configuration. It looks up a
model instance for the request path and parameters, then looks up a
view for that model object to create the response.

The publish module:

* resolves the request into a model object.

* resolves the model object and the request into a view.

* the view then generates a response.

It all starts at :func:`publish`.
