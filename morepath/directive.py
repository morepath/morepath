"""This module contains the extension API for Morepath. It is useful
when you want to define new directives in a Morepath extension.  An
example an extension that does this is `more.static`_.

.. _`more.static`: https://github.com/morepath/more.static

If you just use Morepath you should not have to import from
:mod:`morepath.directive` in your code. Instead you use the directives
defined in here through :class:`morepath.App`.

Morepath uses the Dectate_ library to implement its directives. The
directives are installed on :class:`morepath.App` using the
:meth:`dectate.App.directive` decorator.

We won't repeat the directive documentation here. If you are
interested in creating a custom directive in a Morepath extension it
pays off to look at the source code of this module. If your custom
directive needs to interact with a core directive you can inherit from
them, and/or refer to them with ``group_class``.

When configuration is committed it is written into various
configuration registries which are attached to the
:attr:`dectate.App.config` class attribute. If you implement your own
directive :class:`dectate.Action` that declares one of these
registries in :attr:`dectate.Action.config` you can import their class
from :mod:`morepath.directive`.
