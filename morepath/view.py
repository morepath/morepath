"""Rendering views.

A view is a function that returns something. This can be a
:class:`morepath.Response`, but it can also be a structure (such a
dict) that should be rendered *to* a response. If the view is a JSON
view this dumps this structure as JSON. If the view is a HTML view
this structure can be converted to HTML using a template.

:func:`morepath.render_json`, :func:`morepath.render_html` and
:func:`morepath.redirect` are members of the public API.
