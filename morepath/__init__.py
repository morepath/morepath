"""This is the main public API of Morepath.

Additional public APIs can be imported from the :mod:`morepath.error`
and :mod:`morepath.pdbsupport` modules. For custom directive
implementations that interact with core directives for grouping or
subclassing purposes, or that need to use one of the Morepath
registries, you may need to import from :mod:`morepath.directive`.

The other submodules are considered private. If you find yourself
needing to import from them in application or extension code, please
report an issue about it on the Morepath issue tracker.
