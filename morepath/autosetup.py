    """Automatically load Morepath configuration from packages.

    Morepath configuration consists of decorator calls on :class:`App`
    instances, i.e. ``@App.view()`` and ``@App.path()``.

    This function tries to load needed Morepath configuration from all
    packages automatically. This only works if:

     - The package is made available using a ``setup.py`` file.

     - The package or a dependency of the package includes
       ``morepath`` in the ``install_requires`` list of the
       ``setup.py`` file.

     - The ``setup.py`` name is the same as the name of the
       distributed package or module. For example: if the module
       inside the package is named ``myapp`` the package must be named
       ``myapp`` as well (not ``my-app`` or ``MyApp``).

    If the ``setup.py`` name differs from the package name, it's
    possible to specify the module morepath should scan using entry
    points::

        setup(name='some-package',
          ...
          install_requires=[
              'setuptools',
              'morepath'
          ],
          entry_points={
              'morepath': [
                  'scan = somepackage',
              ]
          })

    This function simply recursively imports everything in those packages,
    except for test directories.

    In addition to calling this function you can also import modules
    that use Morepath directives manually, and you can use
    :func:`scan` to automatically import everything in a
    single package.

    Typically called immediately after startup just before the
    application starts serving using WSGI.

    ``autoscan`` always ignores ``.test`` and ``.tests``
    sub-packages -- these are assumed never to contain useful Morepath
    configuration and are not scanned.

    ``autoscan`` can fail with an ``ImportError`` when it tries to
    scan code that imports an optional dependency that is not
    installed. This happens most commonly in test code, which often
    rely on test-only dependencies such as ``pytest`` or ``nose``. If
    those tests are in a ``.test`` or ``.tests`` sub-package they
    are automatically ignored, however.

    If you have a special package with such expected import errors,
    you can exclude them from ``autoscan`` using the ``ignore``
    argument, for instance using ``['special_package']``. You then can
    use :func:`scan` for that package, with a custom
    ``ignore`` argument that excludes the modules that generate import
    errors.

    See also :func:`scan`.

    :param ignore: ignore to ignore some modules
      during scanning. Optional. If ommitted, ignore ``.test`` and
      ``.tests`` packages by default. See :func:`importscan.scan` for
      more details.
